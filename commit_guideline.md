A commit should look like this:

```
<type>: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

And the commit type could look like this:

```
feat – a new feature is introduced with the changes
fix – a bug fix has occurred
chore – changes that do not relate to a fix or feature
refactor – refactored code that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
docs – updates to documentation
style – something like code-formatting
test – including new or correcting previous tests
perf – performance improvements
ci – continuous integration related
build – changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
revert – reverts a previous commit
```
